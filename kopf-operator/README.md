# Kubernetes WordPress Operator - EPFL
Hello there, if you are reading this it means that you want to know more
about this repository, so let's get started !

## Where am I ?
This repository is for the `Kubernetes WordPress Operator` for the `WordPress Next`
project from [ISAS-FSD].
It was initiated in sept-oct 2024 during the "TPI blanc" of [Azecko].

## What's a Kubernetes Operator ?
In simple terms, generally what a Kubernetes Operator does ist that he watches
the Kubernetes cluster and wait for changes, creation, deletion, etc...
When he detects something, he can for exemple creates a Kubernetes pod,
delete one, create some configuration, etc...

## And what about this specific one ?
The objective of this Kubernetes operator is simple.
A kind `WordpressSite` has been defined in `WordPressSite-crd.yaml`. It represents, as it says, a WordPress site.
When a new `kind: WordPressSite` is detected by the operator, it should create
everything that the website needs to work correctly.

At the moment where I'm writing this (October 3rd, 2024) This means :
* a Database
* a User
* a Secret (for the created User)
* a Grant (to give access to the Database to the User)
* setting up the database (creating all the tables, setting the theme, ... using a PHP script)

## Setup
To make it work on your device, follow these steps :
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install all the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Be sure that you have applied the CRD (Custom Resource Definition) (`kubectl apply -f WordPressSite-crd.yaml`)
4. Install [KubeVPN]
5. Connect the VPN to your cluster using `kubevpn connect`
6. If you are on Linux → make sure to run these commands :
    ```
    resolvectl dns utun0 $(kubectl get -n kube-system \
    service/rke2-coredns-rke2-coredns \
    -o jsonpath='{$.spec.clusterIP}')

    NAMESPACE=wordpress-test       # par exemple
    resolvectl domain utun0 $NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local \
    svc.cluster.local cluster.local
    ```
7. Quickly check that your VPN is `connected` using `kubevpn status`
8. Run the operator using `kopf run wpn-kopf.py`
   1. If you want more logs, you can run it with the `--verbose` parameter

## What's next ?
This operator has still a(lot) of work to do, here's some known issues, features, backlog, ...

- [ ] Quotes in site name / tagline, e.g. `Nicolas's site`, are not escaped properly.
- [ ] We need to have a way to make the operator manage Ingresses / Deployment to balance the loads / the numbers of site per pods
- [ ] As for the Ingresses and Deployments, same have to happen with MariaDB (the database server)
- [ ] We have to manage the languages (which could be changed by the users, so this imply some knowledges of the modification made at user level, see next point)
- [ ] We need to have some sort of cron task that read the actual configuration, i.e. language, that are active on a site and write thoses in the kubernetes object (status / annotation)
- [ ] The operator has to create the Databases backup/restore
- [ ] The life cycle of a WordPressSite has to be fully managed by the operator : introduce a thombstone/archive status that can be revived, duplicate a site
- [ ] The CRD should have more filter field (the one that are shown on the `kubectl get wp` output), such as `path`, etc
- [ ] wp-veritas (a clickable interface to manage WordPress sites)

## Contributing
Contributing is always appreciated, but please respect these few steps :
- Write explicit commits, don't just do like `feature`, please do something like `[feature] WordPress CRD can now take 55 languages instead of 50`
- Test everything (as possible) before commiting.
