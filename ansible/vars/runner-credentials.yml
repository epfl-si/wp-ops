# To edit the encrypted secrets below, you need eyaml installed.
# Familiarize yourself with
# https://puppet.com/blog/encrypt-your-data-using-hiera-eyaml first.
# The edit command goes like this,
#
#   ansible/ansible-deps-cache/bin/eyaml edit -d \
#     --pkcs7-public-key ansible/eyaml/epfl_wp_test.pem \
#     ansible/vars/runner-credentials.yml
#
# üí° This *will not* decrypt anything for you because chances are, you
# don't need to decrypt secrets (YA RLY). For those cases where you
# do, wielding the private key from Keybase is left as an exercise to
# the reader.

eyaml_keys:
  priv: "/keybase/team/epfl_wp_test/eyaml-privkey.pem"
  pub: "{{ playbook_dir }}/eyaml/epfl_wp_test.pem"

quay_api:
  # Quay API token that Ansible wields to create mirrors etc.
  # To regenerate this token:
  # (paraphrased from https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#token-overview)
  #
  # 1. Browse https://quay-its.epfl.ch/
  # 2. **Make sure to log out and then back in.** Some token manipulation steps require either
  #    that you have a fresh (less than a few minutes old) session, or that you type in your
  #    password to re-autenticate. Unfortunately the latter will *not* work on quay-its.epfl.ch,
  #    no matter what. (Mumble LDAP something something)
  # 3. Browse https://quay-its.epfl.ch/organization/svc0041?tab=applications
  # 4. (If not already done) Create the `ansible` application. Click the ‚ÄúCreate New Application‚Äù button in the upper right corner; type in Ansible and press Enter.
  #
  #    üí° If you get prompted for a password at this time, it means that you didn't read
  #    the above instructions carefully. Sorry about that.
  # 5. Click the `ansible` hyperlink
  # 6. In the left sidebar, click Generate Token (pictured by a cinema ticket)
  # 7. Check the ‚ÄúAdminister Repositories‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate Repositories‚Äù boxes and leave all others unchecked.
  # 8. Click the Generate Access Token button (green) at the bottom
  # 9. Click Authorize application
  # 10. A token should appear. If it doesn't, see üí°, above.
