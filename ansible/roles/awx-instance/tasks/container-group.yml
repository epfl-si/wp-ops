# Set up a container group for systolic Ansible execution.
#
# As AWX runs tasks in the `tower-elastic` container group, additional containers will be started
# to handle the load; they will be stopped after the Ansible operation completes.
#
# This requires a so-called AWX credential, so that AWX may talk to
# the Kubernetes API server and start and stop pods.
